Dad: <Anger>You never listen!

Son: <Sadness>I was just trying to help...

Dad: <Anger>Help? By ignoring what I said?

Son: <Sadness>I thought it was the right thing to do.

Son: <Sadness>I didn't mean to upset you.

Dad: <Anger>You crossed the line!

Son: I didn't think it would get this bad.

Dad: <Anger>You need to learn respect.

Son: <Sadness>I wish you would just understand.

Dad: <Anger>This conversation is over.
